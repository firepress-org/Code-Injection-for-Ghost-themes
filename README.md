# Code-Injection-for-Ghost-themes


## What is this?

🎨 In Ghost, under the Code injection section, you can insert your code and snippets.

## What can I do with it?

There are a few elements you might want to change on the fly. Per example:

- Logo size
- The color of title & paragraph text
- The distance between a component
- The radius of the pictures
- Add Google analytic
- Add chat on your site via Drift
- etc

You can all this without having the put the code in the theme itself. Pretty cool!


## For which themes?
