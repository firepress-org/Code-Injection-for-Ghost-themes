🙈 I’m aware that this README needs **more love**. Time is the biggest challenge here. Feel free to [buzz me on Twitter ](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy) if you have any questions or comments.

## What does it means for the end-user?

There is a few elements clients wants to easily configure like:

- Logo size
- Color of title & paragraph text
- Radius of the pictures
- etc

## For which themes?

We track the `Code Injection snippets` for each themes that [are curated](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go) by FirePress.
